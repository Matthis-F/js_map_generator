# js_map_generator
Intended as a small school project, this is a hexagons based map generator written in javascript.
* Maps are generated based on two criteria: Height and Humidity. Theses values are obtained with a simplex noise generator. 
* Placement of Cities is completely random.
* Cities names were pre-generated using a markov chain generator.
* Paths between cities are made using a Breadth-first search algorithm.
